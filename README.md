# Ft_Printf
---
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. You will discover variadic functions in C.

## To use the function : 
First include the ft_printf header

Create the libftprintf.a library by makine the makefile rules run: 

	make

![make](imgs/Screen%20Shot%202022-07-09%20at%2004.43.18.png)

Then compile your main.c with the libftprintf.a library

To delete object files after making (files.o) run :

	make clean

To delete the library.a run : 

	make fclean
